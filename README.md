##What is the System Usability Scale (SUS)?
The System Usability Scale (SUS) is "a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability".[2]

It is a tool for measuring the usability of a wide variety of systems and products - hardware, software, websites and computer applications.

It consists of 10 predefined questions in the form of a questionnaire. The response for each question takes the form of a 5 pole Likert scale - each question has five response options; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree.

Each question response provides a score. When all 10 responses are totalled an overall score in the range 0 to 100 is assigned.

Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, at the time working for Digital Computer Corp (DEC) in the UK.


##Purpose of this project
Right now SUS is only reliably available in English. Good quality translations to other languages are scarce (or difficult to find).

The purpose of this project is to attempt to translate the SUS scale questions into other languages so it can be used to measure usability.


##Quality of translation
The quality of SUS question translation is very important.

For the moment, we will try to validate the proposed translations with a number of people to make sure the translations are of the highest quality possible.
