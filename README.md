##Defining "usability"
"Usability does not exist in any absolute sense; it can only be defined with reference to particular contexts. This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a
need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for “quick and dirty” methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation."

(From the abstract of "SUS - A quick and dirty usability scale" by John Brooke 1996. [1])

##System Usability Scale (SUS)
The System Usability Scale (SUS) is "a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability". [2] It is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of a wide variety of systems and products - hardware, software, websites and computer applications.

It consists of 10 predefined questions in the form of a questionnaire. The response for each question takes the form of a 5 pole Lickert scale - each question has five response options; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree.

Each question response provides a score. When all 10 responses are totalled an overall score in the range 0 to 100 is assigned.

Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, at the time working for Digital Computer Corp (DEC) in the UK.

##Purpose of this project
Right now SUS is only reliably available in English. Good quality translations to other languages are scarce (or difficult to find).

The purpose of this project is to attempt to translate the SUS scale questions into other languages so it can be used to measure usability.
